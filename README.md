# 🌍 Greenhouse Gas Emission Analysis – Week 1 Internship Project

This project focuses on analyzing supply chain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across various U.S. industries using the 2015 emission factors dataset.

## 📊 Objective
To identify and visualize the top industries with the highest supply chain GHG emission factors (including margins), using data analysis and visualization techniques in Python.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 🔍 What’s Included
- `Week1_GHG_Analysis.ipynb` – Colab notebook with code to load, process, and visualize the dataset.
- `SupplyChainEmissionFactorsforUSIndustriesCommodities2015_Summary.csv` – Dataset used for the analysis.

## ✅ Key Insights
- Top 10 industries were identified based on total supply chain emission factors (with margins).
- A bar chart visualizes the highest-emitting industries for better understanding and presentation.

## ✍️ Improvisations Made
- Cleaned column names for accuracy.
- Identified actual column labels from the dataset.
- Used clear visualizations with titles and axis formatting.
- Organized code into logical, readable sections.
